# Changelog

All notable changes by phase. Most recent first. Format inspired by
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-19 · Phase 8 hardening

### Fixed
- `0934eb0` — `muse._write_pattern_file` now always emits the
  Anti-pattern section. When the source has no documented failure mode,
  the body shows `_(no anti-pattern documented in source)_` instead of
  silently dropping the heading. Re-ran on `pattern_isef.md`; staging
  cluster lint goes from 22/23 to **23/23 perfect 4/4**.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-19 · Phase 8 — Awesome-list ingest (control + ICS)

### Added
- `d6d17f3` — README: cover Phase 8.
- `82ee0d4` — Scale awesome ingest to 47 entries → 16 new staging clusters.
  Probes: PID + dead time sim 0.82, MPC / DAE sim 0.68, ICS Modbus sim 0.52.
- `4491670` — `src/rosclaw_know/awesome_fetcher.py` (markdown + HTML-table
  parser, GitHub raw README fallback), `scripts/ingest_awesome.py` (with
  `--section`, `--limit`, `--then-ingest`), `scripts/verify_phase8_awesome.py`.
  14 unit tests; first batch over `A-make/awesome-control-theory` and
  `hslatman/awesome-industrial-control-system-security`.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-18 · Phase 7 — Active learning + staging maturation

### Added
- `ef6b96c` — Muse-minted clusters land at `priority: 0` (staging).
- `47b7450` — Adapt `promote.py` + `active_learning.py` to rosclaw-how's
  Phase 6/7 API changes (bucketed `/stats`, `is_staging` flag).
- `de77786` — `src/rosclaw_know/active_learning.py` (DeepSeek autodraft
  from `/wiki/v1/blind_spots`), `scripts/autodraft.py` (CLI, optional
  `--then-ingest`), `scripts/promote.py` (staging→production gate),
  `scripts/verify_phase7_active.py` (8-step joint verify, 6/6 PASS).

## [0.1.0] – [0.6.0] — 2026-05-17 · Phase 1–6 (squashed)

### Added — Phase 1 (offline refinery)
- `c4f9b3e` — Initial commit of the whole offline refinery: harvester,
  weaver, Muse, curated_patterns, pipeline orchestrator, run_phase1.py,
  inspect_samples.py, verify_frontier_eng.py.

### Added — Phase 2 (rosclaw-how joint integration)
*Code lives in rosclaw-how* — included here because pipeline assumptions
were finalised in this phase. See rosclaw-how `2fe1d24`.

### Added — Phase 3 (SeekDB production hot path)
*Code lives in rosclaw-how* (`2fe1d24`). rosclaw-know contribution:
publishing pipeline writes `bridge_index.json` in the shape SeekDB's
asset_loader expects (curated `safety_label_index` + `symptom_clusters`).

### Added — Phase 4 (feedback loop)
Included in `c4f9b3e`:
- `feedback_distill.py` (11 tests) + `scripts/distill_feedback.py`.
- `bridge_reweighter.py` (6 tests) + `scripts/reweight_bridge.py`.
- `scripts/replay_benchmark.py` — 60-rollout synthetic A/B; 6/6 patterns
  correctly classified, 3 soft-deprecated.

### Added — Phase 5 (incremental ingest)
Included in `c4f9b3e`:
- `source_manifest.py` (9 tests) — content-hash dirty detection.
- `incremental_pipeline.py` (5 tests) — selective Muse on new graph nodes,
  non-destructive bridge merge that preserves Phase 4 stats.
- `scripts/ingest.py` and `scripts/lint_bridge.py` (11 tests).
- `scripts/verify_phase5_ingest.py` PASS (TPU XLA cluster routable
  in < 1 s after `/admin/reload`).

### Added — Phase 6 (observability + perf)
Included in `c4f9b3e`:
- `stats_analyze.py` (14 tests) + `scripts/analyze_stats.py` — linear
  regression trend over `/stats` snapshots.
- `scripts/bench_phase6.py` — SLO baseline: build p95 ≤ 400 ms,
  feedback p95 ≤ 150 ms, reload-delta ≤ 5 s, export p95 ≤ 500 ms.

### Added — README + docs structure
- `a65a97c` — README rewrite covering Phase 1-7 closed loop with module
  table + architecture diagram + lifecycle diagram + joint verify list.

## Notes for deployers

- `data/assets/bridge_index.json` is the live contract with rosclaw-how. It
  must remain valid JSON; the `priority` field controls staging/production/
  demoted routing. Treat it as code-reviewable state.
- `data/source_manifest.json` is incremental-ingest cache. Safe to delete
  to force a full re-mine, but you lose the dirty-detection optimisation.
- `data/assets/code_patterns/` filename convention:
  - `<id>.md` — curated patterns (never wiped by Muse).
  - `pattern_<id>.md` — Muse-minted patterns (wiped at start of each full
    Phase 1 `compile_muse_assets`; the incremental pipeline does NOT wipe).
- `wiki/auto_drafted/` is Phase 7 autodraft output; treat as durable.
- `wiki/awesome_corpus/<list_slug>/` is Phase 8 fetched corpus; safe to
  re-run `scripts/ingest_awesome.py` (manifest deduplicates).
